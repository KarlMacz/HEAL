# HEAL
##### See the fun in Fauna!!!

## Inspiration
We believe that learning is at its peak when we are also having fun. Nowadays, youth have engaged much into gaming which is the reason why we incorporated this campaign of awareness through a game which will provide critical information through entertainment.

## What it does
HEAL will immerse the player through the adventures of a ranger in the pursuit of rescuing endangered animals. While on the run, the player will be engaged in various informative battle systems which will promote active learning about the current issues in the wildlife.

## How I built it
The program relied heavily on Unity as the standard platform. We also added Augmented Reality.

## Challenges I ran into
Time Constraints. Even with good time management and work distribution, we weren't able to pull off all the ideas we have for the application.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The team is composed of mostly college students and two professionals. We are proud we we're able to create a prototype game within a short amount of time, starting with no knowledge of the tools we used.

## What I learned
While we are new to game development, we we're able to create a prototype game. We learned a lot during the zoohackathon event. We dived in to learning Unity and Blender.

## What's next for HEAL
Development of this application will be continued as we can see positive impacts of game to others especially the youth.
